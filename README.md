# Jordans

Jordans website has two main tasks:
1. to be among the firsts, to put on market the latest and the Limited Edition shoes coming out from the Jordan Brand House
1. to have a variety of products to satisfy different categories and ages

This website is suitable to who is looking for special edition like the retros or the ones dedicated to special events or 
memories or anniversary of the NBA or Michael Jordan himself.



## Installation

In the head of the project I have installed the links to have access to different ![libraries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans/master/images/jordans-head.png?raw=true)
1. Bootstap 4: a library with templates for buttons, form or other components. For this project I use it to build the responsive navigation bar.
1. Font Awesome: is an icon library. I use this library for the flames in the jordan_in page for example ![flames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans/master/images/jordans-icon.png?raw=true)
1. Cdnjs is a Javascript library and below the external link to the style.css file.


I build this project with a shade of blue responsive navbar, that shows a toggle menu when reduced to screens below 991px.
To build it I followed an accurate and guided video that you can find at this [link](https://youtu.be/gt8zOLQ8A0w)

I enrich the home page with pictures of Jordan collections and cards with shoes on sale and then below the cards you can find 
the links to access the Indoor and Outdoor pages.

The Indoor and the Outdoor pages are the most important because is where our products are exposed.
In our pages you can find shoes for players, but also for who want to wear a pair of Jordans even out of the basket-ball court.

The WhyJordan page is explaining why the Jordans are so competitive on the market and some info on Michael Jordan.

In the contact us page we dedicate a space to our customer to expose ideas regarding any customization of Jordan shoes.

At the end of the homepage I have added a google map provided by Google service. I set a random address in the city where I live (Amsterdam)


## UX
The CSS file is divided by comments, that I used as title to separate the code of every page.
This make any future correction or research much easier.
And I did the same for the mobile and other screen sizes ![css2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans/master/images/jordan-mob.png?raw=true)

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar (or sidenav for screens smaller than 991px) to go to the page of their choice. 
        2. The homepage is composed by two wallpapers representing Jordan shoes collection.
        3. The new user can find in the homepage different Jordan shoes on sale as preview of the two sale sections (Jordan Indoor and Jordan Outdoor) .



    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the application to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of the page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. The logo is always directing the user to the homepage and is always available thanks to the fixed navbar.
        3. The links in the navbar have a background of a shade of orange when the user hover the mouse over them.
        
        
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through a wide choice of products.
        1. When the user enter the website is already welcomed with many shoe models prior to enter the Jordan indoor or Jordan outdoor section.
        2. When the user enter the Jordan Indoor section, can find the top shoes of the moment at the top of the page and the rest of the collection displayed below.
        3. When the user enter the Jordan Outdoor page, can find this section divided in three areas: men, women and kids.


-   #### Returning Visitor Goals
        
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate the site from different devices (laptop, tablet or mobile phone).
        1. The user can have a comfortable navigation with any kind of device because the website is very responsive at every screen size.

    
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to easily find a contact page and be in touch with the store staff.
        1. When the user looks at the fixed navbar, he can easily find the link "Contact Us". The "Contact Us" page give to the user the opportunity to personalize his own shoes and send his idea to the Jordans staff.


-   #### Frequent Visitor Goals
        
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to have easy and fast access to the product informations.
        1. When the user navigates through the products on sale, he can easily have a view of the picture of the shoes, the model name and the price.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check if periodically there are new shoes on sale on the site.
        1. The user can periodically check about new Jordans release on the official Michael Jordan page. Once a new model is released, it will be available on the Jordans website.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to check if there are any newly added function or content.
        1. The user would be already comfortable with the website layout.
         
## Bugs

The site was tested through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for Html and Css.
I had to correct an error in the header. Was about a div nested in a ul.

The project still presenting 2 little bugs in the contacs.html page: 
1. in the form, the "Describe your shoes" area has the cursor not align at the top but in the middle
1. the form is not having regular margin-bottom on all screen sizes despite I made lot of tentatives

The site was also tested through different browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) and different screen sizes

## Deployment

The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans)

The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo).
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index.html) page.
 
To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the [repository]([GitHub](https://github.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans))
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (in my case Gitpod)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
    - ```git clone https://github.com/OmarBedawi/Jordans-ifd-project.git```
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
    - Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.

During development the site is written in Gitpod.
